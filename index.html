            <p>
                I am thrilled to report that your package is well received, 
                with the shells intact and unconfiscated! 
                The pictures and the note brought back a flood of sweet memories.
                Thinking back to kissing you the first time in Ao Nang makes my 
                heart ache in good way. <a class="link">Maybe</a> I got choked up a little? 
                Nobody can say for sure.
            </p>
            <p>
                Thanks for all the games and activities and good belays and kisses and 
                especially the <a class="link">good</a> energy. I can be an angsty little bitch but 
                you often pulled me towards the positive side of things.
            </p>
            <p>
                To be frank, I wish I had opened up to you more. 
                When I left you guys in Laos it 
                <a href="sad.png" title="this is how i felt" class="link">HURT</a>. 
                Can‚Äôt exactly explain why? Anyways‚Ä¶
            </p>
            <p>
                I hope you‚Äôre doing well! Please keep me updated on your 
                life/adventures/send me letters if the postage isn‚Äôt outrageous.
